## First Step 
Clone Repository from GabrielHeinrich
Remote Repository to my new github repository

Create new branch "setup" and create file and folder structure there
Create and fill LICENSE  --read https://choosealicense.com/
Add default structure to index.html with links to stylesheet and other imported styles

Now do first commit to the setup branch
  git commit -am "first commit with filetree"
  or: git add . --> git commit -m "my text here"

Checkout to master
Merge from master with setup
Push master to my-github repository --> git push
Also push the setup branch to my github repository --> git push -u my-github setup
